\section{Overview of the CBM experiment}
\gls{CBM} is a fixed target experiment that aims to measure rare particles as probes of dense matter with very good precision at beam energies up to 12~AGeV. It is well positioned to explore many facets of \gls{QCD} matter and to discover new exotic states. In addition, it will be able to explore the equation of state at densities and temperatures close to those probed by neutron star mergers. The \gls{CBM} aims to study the following physics phenomenon:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the equation of state of baryonic matter at neutron star densities,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item collective behavior and flow anisotropies,
        \item multi-strange baryons,
        \item hyperons and their interactions.
    \end{itemize}
    \item in-medium properties of hadrons which are modified by the restoration of chiral symmetry in the dense baryonic matter, 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item dilepton invariant mass distribution.
    \end{itemize}
    \item phase transitions from hydronic matter to quarkonic or partonic matter,
    \begin{itemize}
        \item dilepton production ("caloric curve"),
        \item 
    \end{itemize}
    \item hypernuclei (double $\lambda$, strange di-baryons etc.),
    \item charm production mechanisms.
\end{enumerate}

Construction of the Compressed Baryonic Matter (\gls{CBM}) experiment is currently underway at \gls{FAIR}. Figure~\ref{fig:exp} depicts the CAD drawing of the \gls{CBM} experiment. The beam enters the experimental cave from the left side and traverses the High Acceptance Di-Electron Spectrometer (\gls{HADES}) experiment.  The main features of the \gls{CBM} experiment are described below:
\begin{itemize}
\item tracking acceptance: $\SI{2.5}{\degree} < \theta_{lab} < \SI{25}{\degree}$,
\item peak intensities reach 10 MHz for Au+Au systems,
\item fast and radiation hard detectors,
\item free-streaming \gls{DAQ},
\item 4D tracking,
\item online event reconstruction and selection,
\item data rates up to 1~TB/s.
\end{itemize}




The CBM detector system can be used in two operation modes: the first one is optimized for electron identification (electron configuration) and the second is specialized for muon identification (muon configuration). In the first one, all the subsystems apart from MUCH will be involved. In the muon configuration, the \gls{RICH} detector is replaced by \gls{MUCH}.



The experiment consists of the following detectors:

\textbf{Beam monitor, or T0 (\gls{BMON})} and its conceptual design, was summarized during the 40th \gls{CBM} Collaboration Meeting~\cite{bmon}. Two separate stations in front of the target are made out of high-purity poly-crystalline CVD diamond material. This detector is foreseen to monitor beam quality (position, time structure) and determine the start time of the reaction.

\textbf{Micro Vertex Detector} (\gls{MVD}) consists of four planar stations with Monolithic Active Pixel Sensor (\gls{MAPS}) chips. A station's layout and distance from the target can be tailored to the needs of a specific run, for example, to optimize vertexing or tracking. The vertexing detector geometry aims at a precision of secondary vertices determination of about 50 -- 100~$\mu m$ along the beam axis. The main aims cover decay vertex identification of the very short-lived particles such as charmed mesons, which decay within a few hundred $\mu m$ behind the target, as well as background rejection in di-electron spectroscopy. More information can be found in the Technical Design Review~\cite{MVD}.

 \textbf{Silicon Tracking System} \gls{STS} which is responsible for tracking of charged particles and measuring their momentum. The \gls{STS} is located inside a superconducting dipole magnet~\cite{Malakhov:109025},
 
\textbf{Muon Chamber System} \gls{MUCH} is the fourth subsystem of the \gls{CBM} experiment. It is dedicated to muon detection (for example rare particles decaying into muons like $J/\psi$) and track reconstruction. This concept is based on layered design of the hadron absorbers (5 layers), separated with tracking detector planes which are based on Gas Electron Multiplication (\gls{GEM}) and Resistive Plate Chambers (\gls{RPC}) detectors~\cite{MUCH}.

\textbf{Ring Imaging Cherenkov Detector} \gls{RICH} is responsible for electron identification via Cherenkov radiation~\cite{RICH}. It allows separating electrons from pions up to 8 GeV/c. The detector consists of \SI{1.7}{\metre} long $CO_{2}$ gas radiators with pion threshold for Cherenkov radiaiton of 4.65 GeV/c, two arrays of mirrors and photon detector planes. Due to the substantial material budget in front of the RICH detector, central Au + Au collisions at 25 AGeV beam energy exhibit on the order of 100 rings. However, models predict that a pion suppression on the level of 500 will be accomplished thanks to the high granularity (about 55 000 channels) and high number of photons per ring~\cite{RICH}.

\textbf{Transition Radiation Detector} \gls{TRD} to suppress pions and to support track reconstruction with 9-10 detector layers grouped into 3 stations. It is placed from approximately \SI{4}{\metre} to \SI{9}{\metre} downstream of the target, and the total active area reaches \SI{600}{\square\metre}. 

\textbf{Time-of-Flight Detector} \gls{TOF} is designed to identify hadrons

\textbf{Projectile Spectator Detector} \gls{PSD} determines the collision centrality and event plane

There are three operational scenarios of the \gls{CBM} experiment. 
The first one called 'hadron' scenario involves using MVD, STS, TRD, TOF and PSD. The 'muon' scenario employs additionally MUCH and the 'electron' scenario features RICH instead of MUCH. 


For the high-rate CBM experiment, the data read-out and acquisition system plays a crucial role. As mentioned above, the time-stamped signals will be read out without event correlation and transferred to a high-performance computing farm, the GSI GreenIT Cube, where online event reconstruction and selection are performed by high-speed algorithms. In the first step, the tracks of the charged particles were reconstructed from the space and time information of the various detector signals. In a second step, the particles will be identified, taking into account secondary decay vertices and information of RICH or MuCh, TRD, and TOF. Finally, the particles will be grouped into events, which will be selected for storage if they contain important observables. In parallel, the event is characterized using information from the PSD.



\section{Thesis overview and its rationale}
The thesis is divided into 7 chapters. The second chapter introduces the role of silicon trackers in large scientific experiments and brings the design details of the \gls{STS} closer, including the physics performance and experimental challenges. Those elements are directly connected with the requirements for the Detector Control System (\gls{DCS}). The third chapter serves as an introduction to how to control and monitor a large experiment, with an extended focus on the detector-related slow control system and the developed control framework. The next three chapters are focused on the results and their consequences for the experiment:
\begin{itemize}
    \item chapter 4 covers the first implementations of the mentioned control framework. The first application is related to the slow control interface for the \gls{FEE} readout. The second and third examples are related to the irradiation studies of the powering modules for the \gls{LV} powering of the \gls{STS} electronics and thermal cycling of \glspl{FEB}. The performed studies and results of these activities are discussed in detail,
    \item chapter 5 describes the efforts to design and test a distributed sensing system for the \gls{STS} with a focus on humidity sensing. Three considered technologies feature capacitive sensors, fiber optic sensors, and remote sensing with the use of a sampling system. The chapter focuses on the design choices and characterization of the fiber Bragg grating-based sensors. 
    \item chapter 6 focuses on the small-scale prototype version of the \gls{STS} in the \gls{mCBM} experiment. The first sections describe in detail the hardware and software solutions implemented in the detector. Subsequently, the results from the full-blown \gls{DCS} are presented and discussed, including the radiation effects on the silicon sensors and general considerations about the power dissipation of different elements of the \gls{STS}'s powering scheme. Moreover, considerations about the \gls{DCS} are given. 
\end{itemize}
The last part of the thesis summarizes the results and sheds a light on the next steps toward the realization of the \gls{STS} and its controls. The most important findings and results from the performed studies are also discussed.

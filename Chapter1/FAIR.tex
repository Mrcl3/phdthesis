\section{Overview of the FAIR facility}
The Facility of Antiproton and Ion Research in Europe (\gls{FAIR})~\cite{fair} is a future international research facility for accelerator-based research.

It will provide unique research opportunities in hadron and nuclear physics, atomic physics, nuclear astrophysics, materials research, plasma physics, and radiation biophysics, including the development of novel medical treatments and applications for space science~\cite{fair1}. 
 
FAIR (see Figure \ref{fig:fair}) will extend GSI with a more capable accelerator (SIS100), storage rings, and dedicated experiments from different fields, namely Atomic Physics, Plasma physics and Applications (APPA), antiProton ANnihilation at DArmstadt (PANDA), Nuclear Structure, Astrophysics, and Reactions (NUSTAR), and Compressed Baryonic Matter (\gls{CBM}). The Schwerionensynchrotron 100 (SIS100) is
the accelerator ring built for FAIR and its experiments. The latest status of SIS100 and its plans were recently described by Spiller~\cite{Spiller_2020}.

The SIS100, which will provide high-intensity beams of protons up
to energy of \gev{29}  with intensities up to $2.5\times 10^{13}$~protons/cycle and nuclei up to \agev{15} for Z/A = 0.5. Gold or uranium beams will be available with kinetic energies up to \agev{11}. Typical intensities for the heavy ions depend also on charge state and vary from 2.7~GeV/u for $\mathrm{U^{28+}}$ ions with $5\times 10^{11}$~ions/cycle to 10~GeV/u for $\mathrm{U^{92+}}$ ions with $4\times 10^{10}$~ions/cycle. High-intensity secondary beams will be produced by a large acceptance Superconducting Fragment Separator, which investigates very efficiently rare isotopes created in reactions with the primary beams.

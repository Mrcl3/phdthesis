\section{Overview of the Silicon Tracking System (STS)}
All semiconductor based detector system include very similar functions. The signals from the detector channels have to be amplified and processed for storage and analysis. The silicon sensors, analog-digital converter and all the necessary support structures are often referred to as a detector module. Nevertheless, there are many parameters that have to be optimized in order to achieve the desired tracker performance. 

The physics observables together with the foreseen accelerator specifications defined in the previous chapter define the requirements for the detector system. The \gls{STS} is designed to provide track reconstruction and momentum determination of the charged particles. The detector has to work with ion beam energies from 2 to 14 AGeV (protons 39 GeV). In addition to that, a very high interaction rate 10~MHz results in up to 700 tracks per central Au+Au collision in the aperture of $\SI{2.5}{\degree} < \theta_{lab} < \SI{25}{\degree}$. The \gls{STS} extends more than \SI{1}{\metre} downstream of the target and will be installed in a volume of \SI{3}{\square\metre}. 

In order to achieve physics goals, \gls{STS} has to address the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item  aperture - the aperture of the whole experiment is expected to cover polar angles from \SI{2}{\degree} up to \SI{25}{\degree}. This range corresponds to center-of-mass rapidity close to the beam rapidity. 
    \item spatial resolution - a single-hit resolution of about \SI{20}{\micro\metre} in X direction and \SI{120}{\micro\metre} in Y, 
    \item single-hit efficiency - the detector layer should provide almost 100\% detection efficiency. The damaging effect of the radiation, implies that the \footnote{ratio of the most probable amplitude for a minimum ionizing particle divided by the root mean square of the single strip noise}{signal-to-noise} ratio needs to be over 10. Having that, the track reconstruction efficiency should exceed 95\% for particle momenta larger than 1~GeV/c. 
    \item momentum resolution - it's mainly influenced by the material budget of the system. The \gls{STS} is designed with the aim to avoid excessive multiple scattering. It is achieved by placing the electronics, mechanical infrastructure and cooling outside the active area. For the \gls{STS} the momentum resolution of $\Delta p/p = 1.5\%$ is foreseen. 
    \item radiation hardness - the silicon sensors and the electronics need to withstand the total dose of 10~kGy~\cite{Heuser:54798}, 
    \item hit rates and readout - the hit rates of charged particles for the inner-most silicon sensors (10~MHz per $\mathrm{cm^{2}}$ provide the requirements for the readout system (signal shaping time, number of readout channels etc.)
\end{itemize}

A simplified CAD drawing of the \gls{STS} is presented in Figure~\ref{fig_STS}.

The detector consists of 876 detectors modules composed of double-sided silicon microstrip sensors, ultralight microcables and Front End Boards (\gls{FEB}) glued on the fins. The modules are distributed on carbon fiber support-structures which populate C-frames~\cite{progress_report_2016}. Two C-frames form a tracking station of \gls{STS}. The modules are produced in 166 variants, which differ in sensors size, micro-cable length and the orientation of the Front End Electronics~(\gls{FEE}). Figure~\ref{fig_assembly} depicts a simplified assembly workflow of \gls{STS}.

\subsection{Role of the semiconductors based detector}




\subsection{Double-sided microstrip silicon sensors}
\label{sensors}
The use of microstrip silicon sensors was demonstrated in other experiments around the world. It's design and thickness are primarily dependent on the constraints related to the scaterring and signal.

Information about the temperatures serves not only to ensure detector safety, but also to properly understand the behavior of the silicon sensors. One of the important parameters of the silicon sensor is leakage current, which is strongly correlated with the temperature, as per equation \ref{Sil:temp}~\cite{Hartmann:2017gzy}.

\begin{equation}
\label{Sil:temp}
    I_{R}(T) \propto T^{2}e^{\frac{-E}{2kT}}
\end{equation}
 By assuming that one of the  temperature sensors at a similar height as the silicon sensors mimics their temperature. This assumption clearly doesn't consider several effects like silicon sensors' self-heating. Nevertheless, it allows us to scale down leakage current to $20\,^{\circ}$C using the equation \ref{Sil:scal}.
 
\begin{equation}
\label{Sil:scal}
    \frac{I_{R}(T_{2})}{I_{R}(T_{1})} = (\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}})^{2}e^{\frac{-E}{2kT}\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{T_{1}T_{2}}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Module}
\label{module}
 The assembly of the detector is realized stepwise. The whole complex procedure requires utmost care and extremely high precision. Therefore, a proper workflow was developed to address the complexity of the module assembly~\cite{carmen2}.

\subsection{Alternative readout chains for testing purposes}

\subsection{DPB-based readout chain}

\subsection{Tester readout chain}

There are three main readout chains that have been exercised for different detector development activities.  
The readout chain used in the module or FEBs test is built from two components: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the Common Readout Board (\gls{CROB}) for data concentration and transport with electrical to optical interface (see figure 
    \item Data Processing Board (DPB) based on the AFCK board (see Fig.
\end{enumerate}

\label{tester}
Another alternative to the two readout chains introduced in the last two sections is the so-called GBTxEMU-based tester. It is based on a commercial Artix-7 board (TE-0712, Trenz Electronics Gmbh), and allows emulating GBTX ASIC or the whole CROB. Moreover, it could also be used in an autonomous mode with the addition of VITA  57.1 FMC adapter

\section{System safety and the consequences}
\subsection{Requirements for the control system}
\label{sys:req}
Custom solutions that are applied in \gls{STS} make the control of this system very challenging. Different services imply different control solutions which need to be implemented.
A distributed control system should offer remote control, alarm detection, reporting and logging, modeling and simulation, data processing (archiving, retrieval, plotting, conversion, analysis), common time management, access security, and automatic \footnote{Sequencing, also known as sequential control, it controls the device in a pre-determined order.}{sequencing}.
In addition to that, the \gls{DCS} for the Silicon Tracking System (\gls{STS}) is being designed taking into consideration the following aspects:

 
 \begin{itemize}
    \item potential control framework should offer the possibility to control a variety of different services, which often have different communication protocols,
    \item logging, and monitoring - there should be reliable means of supervision of processes, containers, and \footnote{The input/output controller is a device that interfaces between an input or output device and the computer or hardware device}{Input/Output Controllers} (\glspl{IOC}).
    \item the control software should be horizontally and vertically scalable, when it comes to adding additional computing nodes or applications/Input Output Controllers (\glspl{IOC})/containers,
    \item supervision - it should be possible to integrate a sub-system oriented with higher-level control structures,
     \item flexible - applications should be easy to run on different operating systems and processor architectures,
     \item sustainability and support - the experiment is supposed to run for about 10 years, excluding the building and commissioning time. The control system should be sustainable and long-term support provided,
     \item reliability - the system should be highly available, minimizing the downtimes,
     \item network separation - it should be running in a dedicated network (divided into several service-oriented subnets) to have a good overview of the processes and communication between the nodes,
     \item \glspl{GUI} - all parameters/\footnote{In control theory, a process variable is the currently measured value of a particular part of a process which is being monitored or controlled}{process variables} should be available in a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (\gls{GUI}). In case of error or malfunction, it should be stated clearly by the software where the error happened, what could be the potential risk and what actions need to be taken.

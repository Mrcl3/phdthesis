Information about the temperatures serves not only to ensure detector safety, but also to properly understand the behavior of the silicon sensors. One of the important parameters of the silicon sensor is leakage current, which is strongly correlated with the temperature, as per equation \ref{Sil:temp}~\cite{Hartmann:2017gzy}.

\begin{equation}
\label{Sil:temp}
    I_{R}(T) \propto T^{2}e^{\frac{-E}{2kT}}
\end{equation}
 By assuming that one of the  temperature sensors at a similar height as the silicon sensors mimics their temperature. This assumption clearly doesn't consider several effects like silicon sensors' self-heating. Nevertheless, it allows us to scale down leakage current to $20\,^{\circ}$C using the equation \ref{Sil:scal}.
 
\begin{equation}
\label{Sil:scal}
    \frac{I_{R}(T_{2})}{I_{R}(T_{1})} = (\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}})^{2}e^{\frac{-E}{2kT}\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{T_{1}T_{2}}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Tester readout chain}

There are three main readout chains that have been exercised for different detector development activities.  
The readout chain used in the module or FEBs test is built from two components: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the Common Readout Board (\gls{CROB}) for data concentration and transport with electrical to optical interface (see figure 
    \item Data Processing Board (DPB) based on the AFCK board (see Fig.
\end{enumerate}

\label{tester}
Another alternative to the two readout chains introduced in the last two sections is the so-called GBTxEMU-based tester. It is based on a commercial Artix-7 board (TE-0712, Trenz Electronics Gmbh), and allows emulating GBTX ASIC or the whole CROB. Moreover, it could also be used in an autonomous mode with the addition of VITA  57.1 FMC adapter

\subsection{Requirements for the control system}
\label{sys:req}
Custom solutions that are applied in \gls{STS} make the control of this system very challenging. Different services imply different control solutions which need to be implemented.
A distributed control system should offer remote control, alarm detection, reporting and logging, modeling and simulation, data processing (archiving, retrieval, plotting, conversion, analysis), common time management, access security, and automatic \footnote{Sequencing, also known as sequential control, it controls the device in a pre-determined order.}{sequencing}.
In addition to that, the \gls{DCS} for the Silicon Tracking System (\gls{STS}) is being designed taking into consideration the following aspects:

 
 \begin{itemize}
    \item potential control framework should offer the possibility to control a variety of different services, which often have different communication protocols,
    \item logging, and monitoring - there should be reliable means of supervision of processes, containers, and \footnote{The input/output controller is a device that interfaces between an input or output device and the computer or hardware device}{Input/Output Controllers} (\glspl{IOC}).
    \item the control software should be horizontally and vertically scalable, when it comes to adding additional computing nodes or applications/Input Output Controllers (\glspl{IOC})/containers,
    \item supervision - it should be possible to integrate a sub-system oriented with higher-level control structures,
     \item flexible - applications should be easy to run on different operating systems and processor architectures,
     \item sustainability and support - the experiment is supposed to run for about 10 years, excluding the building and commissioning time. The control system should be sustainable and long-term support provided,
     \item reliability - the system should be highly available, minimizing the downtimes,
     \item network separation - it should be running in a dedicated network (divided into several service-oriented subnets) to have a good overview of the processes and communication between the nodes,
     \item \glspl{GUI} - all parameters/\footnote{In control theory, a process variable is the currently measured value of a particular part of a process which is being monitored or controlled}{process variables} should be available in a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (\gls{GUI}). In case of error or malfunction, it should be stated clearly by the software where the error happened, what could be the potential risk and what actions need to be taken.

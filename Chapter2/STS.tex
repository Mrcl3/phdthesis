\subsection{Role of the tracker}
\subsection{Silicon Sensors}
\label{sensors}
One of the important parameters of the silicon sensor is leakage current, which is strongly correlated with the temperature as per equation \ref{Sil:temp} \cite{Hartmann:2017gzy}.

\begin{equation}
\label{Sil:temp}
    I_{R}(T) \propto T^{2}e^{\frac{-E}{2kT}}
\end{equation}
 By assuming that one of the  temperature sensors at a similar height as the silicon sensors mimics their temperature. This assumption clearly doesn't consider several effects like silicon sensors' self-heating. Nevertheless, it allows us to scale down leakage current to $20\,^{\circ}$C using the equation \ref{Sil:scal}.
 
\begin{equation}
\label{Sil:scal}
    \frac{I_{R}(T_{2})}{I_{R}(T_{1})} = (\frac{T_{2}}{T_{1}})^{2}e^{\frac{-E}{2kT}\frac{T_{1}-T_{2}}{T_{1}T_{2}}}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Readout chains}
\label{DAQ}
There are three main readout chains that have been exercised for different detector development activities.  
The readout chain used in the module or FEBs test is built from two components: 
\begin{enumerate}
    \item the Common Readout Board (\gls{CROB}) for data concentration and transport with electrical to optical interface (see figure \ref{fig_crob}.
    \item Data Processing Board (DPB) based on the AFCK board (see Fig.~\ref{afck_pic})
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tester readout chain}
\label{tester}
Another alternative to the two readout chains introduced in the last two sections is so-called GBTxEMU-based tester. It is based on a commercial Artix-7 board (TE-0712, Trenz Electronics Gmbh), and allows emulating GBTX ASIC or the whole CROB. Moreover, it could also be used in an autonomous mode with the addition of VITA  57.1 FMC adapter

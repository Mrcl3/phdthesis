\subsection{Control system for the CBM experiment}
\gls{EPICS} was chosen, as a software platform to implement the \gls{CBM} \gls{DCS}. More detailed explanations of how \gls{EPICS} works are described in the next sections. According to \cite{EPICS_DOCS}, the basic attributes of \gls{EPICS} are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item tool based -- minimized need for custom coding,
    \item distributed -- an arbitrary number of \glspl{IOC} and \glspl{OPI}, as long as the network does not saturate,
    \item event driven -- it is designed to be event-driven to the maximum extent possible,
    \item high performance, robust,
    \item scalable,
    \item under constant development (see latest updates related to the Control System Studio and PVA).
\end{itemize}

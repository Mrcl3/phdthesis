\subsection{Control system for the CBM experiment}
\gls{EPICS} was chosen, as a software platform to implement the \gls{CBM} \gls{DCS}. More detailed explanations of how \gls{EPICS} works are described in the next sections. According to \cite{EPICS_DOCS}, the basic attributes of \gls{EPICS} are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Tool based -- minimized need for custom coding
    \item Distributed -- an arbitrary number of \glspl{IOC} and \glspl{OPI}, as long as the network does not saturate
    \item Event driven -- it is designed to be event-driven to the maximum extent possible
    \item High performance, robust
    \item Scalable
    \item Under constant development (see latest updates related to the Control System Studio and PVA)
\end{itemize}

\section{Monitoring of the Frond End Electronics}
The first application of the introduced control framework was to read out several parameters from different readout chains (see section \ref{readout} for a detailed explanation of different readout chains). The \gls{ROB} and \gls{DPB} based readout chain was mostly used to evaluate the possibility of interfacing the values from the \gls{DAQ} chain to the slow control and \gls{EPICS} based system. The purpose, similarly to the GBTxEMU chain, was to monitor the stability of the readouts throughout different tests, e.g. thermal cycling of the \gls{FEE}. A maximum of 2 FEBs - 16 STS-XYTERs were used, so in total 112 process variables were monitored, which makes it a small setup. Those values were then stored in a database and are available from Phoebus. 

The available parameters included those available from \gls{GBT} \gls{SCA2} \gls{ASIC} \cite{GBT_SCA_ASIC} and three GBTX chips: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item GBT SCA - RSSI (Received Single Strength Indicator), Input voltage $V_{in}$, 1.5V DC/DC converter output voltage $V_{out}$, 2.5V DC/DC converter output voltage $V_{out}$ (see figure \ref{fig:ROB}), two temperature sensors
    \item GBTX \gls{ASIC} - FEC (Forward Error Correction) counts
\end{itemize}

The STS-XYTER provides the following values - almost full counter, event missed counter, single event upset counter, the status register, and \gls{DAC} values: $V_{ddm}$, \gls{CSA} bias, temperature.

FEE monitoring plays a crucial role in the detector operation but also during the testing phase. Internal parameters of the ASICs in the \gls{ROB} or \gls{FEB} deliver information about the stability and onset of failure. %\subsection{Parameters of the STS-XYTERv2 ASIC}

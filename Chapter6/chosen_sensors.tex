\section{Final considerations}
Three different sensor technologies will be measuring the ambient parameters: Fiber Optic Sensors (FOS FBG-based), commercially available capacitive sensors (SHT series), and a sniffing system based on trace humidity sensors.
Several sniffing points inside the detector enclosure will measure trace humidity and serve as a  reference for the two other measurement technologies. Moreover, the sniffing system is going to be the base for the interlock system, which will take action in case of hazardous humidity levels. In this contribution, we summarize efforts to choose, design, and characterize RH FBG FOS.

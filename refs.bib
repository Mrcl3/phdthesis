abstract = {The Compressed Baryonic Matter experiment (CBM) is a next-generation heavy-ion experiment to be operated at the FAIR facility, currently under construction in Darmstadt, Germany. A key feature of CBM is very high interaction rate, exceeding those of contemporary nuclear collision experiments by several orders of magnitude. Such interaction rates forbid a conventional, hardware-triggered readout; instead, experiment data will be freely streaming from self-triggered front-end electronics. In order to reduce the huge raw data volume to a recordable rate, data will be selected exclusively on CPU, which necessitates partial event reconstruction in real-time. Consequently, the traditional segregation of online and offline software vanishes; an integrated on- and offline data processing concept is called for. In this paper, we will report on concepts and developments for computing for CBM as well as on the status of preparations for its first physics run.}

author = {Alduchov, O A and Eskridge, R E},
abstractNote = {Relative humidity is usually measured in aerological observations and dew point depression is usually reported in upper-air reports. These variables must frequently be converted to other moisture variables in meteorological analysis. If relative humidity is converted to vapor pressure, most humidity variables can then be determined. Elliott and Gaffen reviewed the practices and procedures of the US radiosonde system. In their paper, a comparison of the relative errors was made between the saturation vapor pressure formulations of Tetens (1930), Goff-Gratch (1946), Wexler (1976), and Buck (1981). In this paper, the authors will expand the analysis of Elliott and Gaffen by deriving several new saturation vapor pressure formulas, and reviewing the various errors in these formulations. They will show that two of the new formulations of vapor pressure over water and ice are superior to existing formulas. Upper air temperature data are found to vary from about +50 C to {minus}80 C. This large variation requires a saturation vapor pressure equation to be accurate over a large temperature range. While the errors introduced by the use of relatively inaccurate conversion equations are smaller than the errors due to the instruments, dewpoint coding errors, and dewpoint conversion algorithms (Elliott and Gaffen, 1993); they introduce additional systematic errors in humidity data. The most precise formulation of vapor pressure over a plane surface of water was given by Wexler (1976). The relative errors of Tetens` (1930) formula and one due to Buck (1981) (Buck`s equation is recommended in the Federal Meteorological Handbook No. 3, 1991) are shown. The relative errors in this table are the predicted value minus the Wexler value divided by the Wexler value.},

ABSTRACT = {This review offers new perspectives on the subject and highlights an area in need of further research. It includes an analysis of current scientific literature mainly covering the last decade and examines the trends in the development of electronic, acoustic, and optical-fiber humidity sensors over this period. The major findings indicate that a new generation of sensor technology based on optical fibers is emerging. The current trends suggest that electronic humidity sensors could soon be replaced by sensors that are based on photonic structures. Recent scientific advances are expected to allow dedicated systems to avoid the relatively high price of interrogation modules that is currently a major disadvantage of fiber-based sensors.},

The sensing scheme used in this work builds upon previous research and extends the application of FBGs in chemical sensing by employing a moisture sensitive polymer coating to induce a mechanical strain on the device through volume expansion. The swelling of the polymer coating as a result of the moisture absorption changes the Bragg wavelength of the FBG, thus giving a direct indication of the humidity level. Sensors with different coating thicknesses were evaluated through a series of experiments carried out over a range of values of RH and temperature to investigate various sensing characteristics which include the RH and temperature sensitivity, the time response and the hysteresis effect. All the sensors tested show a linear and reproducible response with a small degree of hysteresis.}

This article presents a comprehensive and systematic overview of FBG sensor technology regarding many aspects including sensing principles, properties, fabrication, interrogation and multiplexing of FBG sensors. It is anticipated that FBG sensor systems will be commercialized and widely applied in practice in the near future due to the maturity of economical production of FBGs and the availability of cost effective interrogation and multiplexing techniques.}

Degradation consists of the decreasing of the upper RH limit that can be measured. At the same time, low RH-level sensitivity is almost stable. After 30 krad of absorption dose, RH cut off is equal to 85\% of max value, after 60 krad–40\%. Degradation reduces after annealing which indicates high radiation sensitivity of the internal circuit in comparison to RH-sensing polymer film.}

                      performance of the Muon Chamber (MuCh) System of the
                      Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at FAIR. The
                      MuCh system is designed to identify muon pairs which are
                      produced in high-energy heavy-ion collisions in the beam
                      energy range from 4 to 40 AGeV. The measurement of lepton
                      pairs is a central part of the CBM research program, as they
                      are very sensitive diagnostic probes of the conditions
                      inside the fireball. At low invariant masses, dileptons
                      provide information on the in-medium modification of vector
                      mesons which is a promising observable for the restoration
                      of chiral symmetry. At intermediate invariant masses, the
                      dilepton spectrum is dominated by thermal radiation from the
                      fireball reflecting its temperature. At invariant masses
                      around 3 GeV/c2, dileptons are the appropriate tool to study
                      the anomalous charmonium suppression in the deconfined
                      phase. In the CBM experiment both electrons and muons will
                      be measured in order to obtain a consistent and
                      comprehensive picture of the dilepton physics.},

abstract = {The Beam Energy Scan program (BES) at the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) is dedicated to explore the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) phase diagram and to search for the critical point of the QCD phase transition. The results from the BES phase I program show hints of a first-order phase transition in the QCD phase diagram and the turn-off of the characteristic signatures of the quark gluon plasma at low collision energies, sNN<20GeV. Three upgrades of the STAR detector, the inner Time Projection Chamber, the Event Plane Detector, and the endcap Time Of Flight, provide unique opportunities to further investigate the nature of the QCD phase diagram during the BES phase II program (BES II), which covers the sNN from 7.7 to 19.6 GeV in the collider mode and from 3 to 7.7 GeV in the fixed-target mode. Beyond the BES II, the STAR Collaboration currently designs, constructs, and installs a suite of new detectors in the forward rapidity region (2.5 < η < 4) over the next two years, enabling a program of novel measurements in p+p, p+A and A+A collisions. This extension of STAR's kinematic reach will allow a detailed study of cold QCD physics at both very high and very low partonic momentum fraction. The new subdetectors to be installed comprise a Forward Calorimeter System, with electromagnetic and hadronic calorimetry. As well as a Forward Tracking System, which consists of 3 layers of silicon mini-strip detectors and 4 layers of small-strip Thin Gap Chambers. In this presentation, the detailed description on the STAR detector upgrades for the BES II and beyond, their performance, as well as the future physics opportunities, will be given.}

abstract = {The Beam Energy Scan (BES) program is being pursued at RHIC to study the QCD phase diagram, and search for the possible QCD phase boundary and possible QCD critical point. The data for Phase-I of the BES program have been collected for Au+Au collisions at center-of-mass energies (sNN)of7.7,11.5,19.6,27,and39GeV. These collision energies allowed the STAR experiment to cover a wide range of baryon chemical potential μB(100–400MeV) in the QCD phase diagram. We report on several interesting results from the BES Phase-I covering the high net-baryon density region. These results shed light on particle production mechanism and freeze-out conditions, first-order phase transition and “turn-off” of QGP signatures, and existence of a critical point in the phase diagram. Finally, we give an outlook for the future BES Phase-II program and a possible fixed target program at STAR.}

STS will be built from 8 detector stations located in the aperture of the magnet. Each station will be built from double-sided silicon strip detectors and connected via kapton microcables to the readout electronics at the perimeter of each station. The challenging physics program of the CBM experiment requires from the detector systems very high performance. Design of the readout ASIC requires finding an optimal solution for interaction time and input charge measurements in the presence of: tight area (channel pitch: 58 μ m), noise (&lt; 1000 e- rms), power (&lt; 10 mW/channel), radiation hardness and speed requirements (average hit rate: 250 khit/s/channel).  This paper presents the front-end electronics' analysis towards prototype STS and MUCH readout ASIC implementation in the UMC 180 nm CMOS process and in-system performance with the emphasis on preferable detector and kapton microcable parameters and input amplifiers' architecture and design.}

                      performance of the Transition Radiation Detector (TRD) of
                      the Compressed Baryonic Matter (CBM) experiment at FAIR. The
                      main task of the TRD is to identify electrons above momenta
                      of 1 GeV/c and thus to extend the electron identification
                      capabilities of the Ring Image CHerenkov (RICH) detector
                      above momenta of p ~ 5 GeV/c. This identification has to be
                      achieved with a pion suppression factor of about 20 at
                      $90\%$ electron efficiency, in order to allow for a
                      measurement of dielectrons in the mass range from below the
                      rho and omega masses to beyond the J/psi mass with a good
                      signal-to-background ratio. Due to its capability of
                      identifying charged particles via their specific energy
                      loss, the TRD in addition will provide valuable information
                      for the measurement of nuclear fragments. This is in
                      particular important for the separation of, e.g, deuterons
                      and 4He, which cannot be achieved using a time-of-flight
                      measurement alone.},
